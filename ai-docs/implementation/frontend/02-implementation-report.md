## Technical Architecture

### Communication Pattern
- **Golden Rule Compliance:** ✅ The frontend communicates ONLY with the API Gateway
- **Base URL:** `http://localhost:5000/api`
- **Authentication:** Bearer token in Authorization header
- **API Endpoints Used:**
  - `POST /api/users/login`
  - `POST /api/users/register`
  - `GET /api/books`
  - `GET /api/books/{id}`
  - `POST /api/books` (Admin)
  - `PUT /api/books/{id}` (Admin)
  - `DELETE /api/books/{id}` (Admin)
  - `POST /api/loans`
  - `PUT /api/loans/{id}/return`
  - `GET /api/users/{userId}/loans`
